# Javascript-capstone-project

The JavaScript capstone project is about building a web application based on an external API. We selected an API that provides data about Pokemon and then build the webapp around it. The webapp has 2 user interfaces:
- A home page showing a list of items that you can "like."
- A popup window with more data about an item that you can comment on it or reserve it for a period of time.
